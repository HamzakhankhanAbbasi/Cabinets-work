					    All in-stock orders will follow a standard lead time of up to 21 business days, plus freight transit
                        time. This lead time may be extended in the event of any revisions to the original order by the
                        customer or backordered items. Once your order leaves our warehouse, you will receive an
                        email containing tracking information for your shipment. The freight company will call 24 hours in
                        advance to schedule your delivery appointment and ensure that someone is available to accept
                        the shipment. We recommend the buyer does not schedule installation until the product is
                        received.
				    </p>
					<p class="heading">Upon product delivery, please do the following:</p>
					<p>
					    Please inspect the shipment immediately. Photos are not required, but are recommended for
                        your personal records and safety in the rate event that a freight claim needs to be filed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Make a notation of any damage and/or shortages on the delivery receipt with a representative

                        refused, the buyer will be responsible for applicable freight charges to and from the destination.

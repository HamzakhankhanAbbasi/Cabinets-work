					    Just as no two trees are alike, no two pieces of wood are alike. The variation in color and grain pattern in wood adds to its natural beauty and is not considered an imperfection. Environmental factors, including but not limited to artificial/ natural light, moisture, cleaners, smoke, etc., may cause the darkening or mellowing of a cabinet over time. This is a natural process and can be expected. This warranty does not cover the natural aging or darkening/ mellowing of wood color, the inherent growth characteristics of, or variation in wood
					</p>
					
					<p>
					    Some of the cabinet lines feature a glazed finish which accentuates the door and drawer front profiles. This glaze is hand applied over a stain or paint and may, due to the nature of application, consist of random drips, runs, etc. As glazing is a hand applied process there will be variations in color and appearance form door to door and cabinet to cabinet. This is not considered a defect and is considered normal with hand applied finishes
					</p>
					
					<p>
					    It is the nature of wood to expand and contract to varying degrees depending on climate conditions. As a result, cabinet lines with painted surfaces may show fractures in the paint at joints. This is normal and is not considered a defect.  

					</p>
